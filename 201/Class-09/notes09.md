## Learn JS - Intro to Events

1. Events occur when you interact with the button connected to the prompt
2. an event ("onclick" or "mouseover" etc) and the function connected to the event (usually a on-click function)
3. An event object keeps track of various events that occur on the page, and the tragets inside the EO are useful because they are used to identify which element the event originated from
4. In the capturing phase, the event moves down towards the element while in the bubbling phase, the event "bubbles up" from the element
