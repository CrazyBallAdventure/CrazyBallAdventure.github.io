## What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript
1. A syntax error is a type of error that occurs when there is a violation of the programming language's syntax rules. Syntax errors are usually easy to spot because the code will not compile or run at all, and the programming environment will often highlight the error and provide a specific error message. A logic error, on the other hand, occurs when the code does not produce the expected output or behavior, even though it may run without errors. Logic errors are more difficult to identify because the code can still run and may not necessarily produce an error message.
2. Most of my errors dealt with synax errors that were easy to fix, hard to spot (personally) due to such a crampped interface 
3. Troubleshooting code will always be relevent if i continue to code longterm and will influence me to take some time to make sure everything is written and executed properly

## The JavaScript Debugger
1.  The debugger tool provides a graphical user interface that helps developers step through their code, set breakpoints, and examine variables and expressions to understand how their code is executing
2. a breakpoint is a tool used by developers to pause the execution of a program at a specific line of code during debugging.
3. The call stack is a data structure used by programming languages to keep track of the order in which function calls are made in a program. The call stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack, meaning that the most recently called function is always at the top of the stack and will be the first to return.
