+ Clients are the people using the computer and the servers are the computer that store internet information

The process of how a web browser gets the information for its client is as follows; the browser goes to the DNS server to get the web address > the browser sends an HTTP request to the server to share web data to the client > the client is able to view the web data

1. An HTML attribute is what provides elements with additional information
2. There are 4 main parts to a HTML element, which are; the opening tag, the closing tag, the content (usually text), and the element itself (in the end).
3. The article tag contains independent content that doesnt require any other context and the section tag is used to split a page into sections, though they can be used in similar ways.
4. The basic elements of a working website are; a header/nav bar, a side bar, website content, and a footer
5. Metadata tells search engines fow to read & display sites on SERPs
6. The meta tag goes inside the head element and used to specify character set, page description, keywords, authour of the document, and viewport settings

## Intro to HTML

HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to text to give it different meaning within a document.
The head of an HTML document is the part that isnt displayed and contains info such as the page title, links to CSS, links to custom favicon, and metadata.
The main job of HTML is to give meaning to text (known as semantics) so that the browser knows how to display the information correctly.
As well as defining individual parts of a page, HTML can also define areas of the website such as headers, navigation menu, and anything dealing with the structure of the website
