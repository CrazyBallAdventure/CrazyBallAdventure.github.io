## JavaScript Object Basics
```
1. Objects are collections of related data. They hold whatever type of content you put inside.
2. Creating object literals is convient, reusable, flexible in declaration, and use less code during declarations
3. They differ because objects stores a collection of data and is not ordered, while arrays are used to represent a list of values
4. Two situtations you would use bracket notation rather than dot notation are when you want to use a varible to access a property or if a property has special characters in its name
5. "this" is referring to the dog's name that was entered in a const data and its recalling property data through a keyword. its advantage is that its reusable and uses less code because its recalling already entered data
```

## Introduction to The DOM
```
1. DOM stands for Document Object Model which is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the document as nodes and objects so programming languages can interact with the page
2. They interact with each other because JS can be used to modify the DOM via the scripting language while the DOM defines the entities describing any doc and the objects within it
