## Introduction to HTML

HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document.

Unordered lists are bullet-point
Emphasis (em) slightly italizes the words in the element while italics (i) completely italizes the words.

Subscript (sub) and superscript (sup) allow you to put text above and below the main text
