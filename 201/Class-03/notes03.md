## Learning HTML
<ol>
1. When marking things up that should be in a list and they dont have any hierarchy of importance
2. By using the <.style> attribute
3. If the items within the list have importance, you should use an ordered list. if not, use an unordered list
4. by using the style attributes such as reversed, start, and type
</ol>

## Learning CSS

Everything in CSS has a box around it and being able to understand the boxes is how you can create more complex layouts with CSS.
The 2 categories of boxes in CSS are block boxes and inline boxes, which refer to how the boxes behave in relation to other boxes. They have 2 types of displays; inner display type and outer display type.

<ol>
1. The margin is the protaginist because its the outermost layer that has every block property within it and the padding is a side character that sits around content
2. <ul>
+ Content box: houses text within the HTML
+ Padding box: Is used to set a perimeter around the box that hold the content
+ Border box: Outlines the box that holds the content and the padding
+ Margin box: Holds the previous 3 within itself and provides blank space that can be customized
 </ul>
</ol>

## Learning JS

<ol>
1. you can store numbers, strings, boolean values (true and false), and charaters/words
2.  it is a valid array and you can access the stored values by using console.log() or using an alert to display the data
3. <ul>
+ Addition assignment - adds values - .x += f(). 
+ Subtraction assignment - subtracts values - .x -= f(). 
+ Multiplication assignment - multiplies values - .x *= f()
+ Exponentiation assignment - add an exponent to the value - .x **= f().
+ Division assignment - divides values - .x /= f().
</ul>
4. the output would be 10dog since the code does not run the c = false statement
5. A scale app could possible use a JS program by using a function to count how many items a person using the scale puts onto the reader.
6. When a question has more than 1 right answer, a loop is useful.
