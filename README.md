<h1> Lui's Growth Mindset </h1>
<p> Growth mindset to me is to think about and manifest success for onesself and it will help motivate you to grow in whatever area you're in. </p>
<p> 3 reminders I can use to keep my growth mindset is that **progress takes time and the results are not immediate**, **work smarter not harder**, and that **its always ok to ask for help whenever you need it** </p>
