### What is CSS

CSS is a computer language used for specifying how documents are presented to the user, ie the style and layout.
 CSS can be used for basic document text styling , like changing the colour and size of heading texts, creating layouts for the webpage, and even effects.

  Inside the curly braces are declarations that specifically style the h1 text

### 3 ways to insert CSS

+ External CSS - You can change the look of the entire website, is defined in the ESS (external style sheet) inside the <link> element, can be written in any text editor, and must be saved as a .css extension.
