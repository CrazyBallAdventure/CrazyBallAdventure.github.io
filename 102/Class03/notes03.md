## Module 3

## What is Version Control?
Version Control is  a system that allows you to revisit versions of files by recording changes, You can revert files to previous versions, track modifications, and compare changes.
there are three types of version control;
+ Local Version Control allows you to save databases to your hard disk, storing the changes for that file
+ Centralized Version Control is used for collaboration between a team on a file/set of files. This system stores the changes to the file and makes it easy for multiple clients to access the files, allowing collaborators to have more knowledge of their teammates' activities
+ Distributed Version Control allows collaborators to create mirrored repositories when they cannot access the Local VCS and help replace any missing information

## What is Git?
Git is a DVCS that stores data in the form of snapshots.
Files saved by git can reside in 3 stages
+ commited
+ modified
+ staged
