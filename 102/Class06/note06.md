### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or compiled programming language with first-class functions.
    JavaScript is used by both web pages and non-browser enviroments for its prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles.
        JS has many capabilities like runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation, oject introspection, and source-code recovery.
    **Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language â€” JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.**
