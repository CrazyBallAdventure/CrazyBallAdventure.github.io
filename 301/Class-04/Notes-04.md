What is a ‘Controlled Component’? <br>
-An input form element whoes value is controlled by React

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why. <br>
-We should update the users info as soon as its entered so the site can stay up-to-date, immidiately storing and refreshing data.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field? <br>
-Using uncontrolled components so it doesnt automatically update to the site

*The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained*

Why would we use a ternary operator? <br>
-So you are able to assign one value to a varible if the condition is true and another value to a varible is the condition is false

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement: <br>
`x===y = value if true : value if false`
