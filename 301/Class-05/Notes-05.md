*This information is important because it explains the best way to determine if something is state as well as how to identify state.*

*React Docs - Thinking in React*

What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components? <br>
-Components should only have one responsibility, and it applies by assigning each component a specific task

What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application? <br>
-Make a version without any interactivity

Once you have a static application, what do you need to add? <br>
-Interactivity and State

What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state? <br>
-Does it remain unchanged over time
 Is it passed in from a parent via props
 Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component


How can you identify where state needs to live? <br>
Keep the filter text and state values

*Higher-Order Functions*

What is a “higher-order function”? <br>
-Functions that operate on other functions either by taking them as arguments or by returning them

Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing? <br>
-creating a function that returns another function that checks if a number is greater than the number passed as an argument

Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions. <br>
-Reduce computes a single value from an array and builds a value by repeatedly taking a single element from the array and combining it with the current value
