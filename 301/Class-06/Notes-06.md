Who is Roy Fielding? <br>
-A smart man who helped write the first web servers 

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? <br>
-Because the techniques we use today are for computers to talk to each other instead of the original tehnique from years ago.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? <br>
-"Its capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world; its the foundation of the web."

What does a GET do? <br>
-Grabs data from a data source with help from the internet

What does a POST do? <br>
-A POST request is used to send data to the API server to create/update a resource

What does PUT do? <br>
