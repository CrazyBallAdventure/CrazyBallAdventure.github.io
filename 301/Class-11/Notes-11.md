*This lesson is important because it explains what SQL & NoSQL are and introduces MongoDB and what it does*

*nosql vs sql*

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL	vs NoSQL<br>
   1. SQL databases are called as Relational Databases | NoSQL databases are called as non-relational/distributed databases
   2. SQL databases are table based | NoSQL databases are document based (key values pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores) 
   3. SQL databases have predefined schema | NoSQL have dynamic schema for unscructured data
   4. SQL databases are verically scalable | NoSQL are horizontally scalable
   5. SQL is a good fit for complex query intensive environment | NoSQL is not a good fit for complex queries

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?<br>
-Structured data

Give a real world example.<br>
-Numbers, dates, and strings (words) that can but displayed in rows, columns, and relational databases

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?<br>
-Semi-structured or unstructured data 

Give a real world example.<br>
-Images, audio, and video that cannot be displayed in rows, columns, and relational databases

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?<br>
-NoSQL because it follows the key-value pair way of storing data

Which type of database is best for scalability?<br>
-NoSQL because you can scale then both horizontally and vertically and are designed to handle large volumes of data


*sql vs nosql (Video)*

What does SQL stand for?<br>
-Structured query language

What is a relational database?<br>
-A type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

What type of structure does a relational database work with?<br>
-It works with rows and columns (tables)

What is a ‘schema’?<br>
-A schema defines how data is organized within a relational database

What is a NoSQL database?<br>
-Non-tabular databases that store data differently from relational tables

How does it work?<br>
-NoSQL stores data via documents rather than relational tables

What is inside of a MongoDB database?<br>
-Collections of documents and tables

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.<br>
-MongoDB is more flexible because it doesnt need to use a schema and its not structured so you can manipulate it freely

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?<br>
-You get duplicated data and you manulally have to update all data if something changes in the collections
